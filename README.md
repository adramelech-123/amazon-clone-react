## Call API

The provided code is a JavaScript module that utilizes the Axios library to make an HTTP GET request to an API endpoint. Let's break it down step by step:

### Import Statements:
```javascript
import axios from "axios";
import { BASE_URL } from "./constants";
```
- `axios` is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from the browser or Node.js. It simplifies the process of sending asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints.
- `BASE_URL` is imported from a file named `constants`. This likely holds the base URL of the API that will be used in the HTTP requests.

### Configuration Object:
```javascript
const config = {
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
  },
};
```
- `config` is an object containing headers that will be sent along with the HTTP request. In this case, it specifies that the request's content type is JSON (`"Content-Type": "application/json"`) and that the client expects to receive JSON data in response (`"Accept": "application/json"`).

### `callAPI` Function:
```javascript
export const callAPI = async (resource) => {
    const {data} = await axios.get(`${BASE_URL}/${resource}`, config )
    return data
}
```
- `callAPI` is an asynchronous function that takes a `resource` parameter. It's designed to make GET requests to different API endpoints by appending the `resource` parameter to the base URL.
- Inside the function:
  - `axios.get()` is used to send a GET request to the specified URL, which is constructed by combining the `BASE_URL` constant with the `resource` parameter.
  - `config` is passed as the second argument to `axios.get()`, ensuring that the defined headers (Content-Type and Accept) are included in this GET request.
  - `await` is used before `axios.get()` to asynchronously wait for the response to be received before proceeding.
  - The response object is destructured, extracting the `data` property from it.
  - Finally, the function returns the `data` received from the API endpoint.

### Summary:
This code essentially defines a function `callAPI` that makes a GET request to an API endpoint using Axios. It allows for easy retrieval of data from different endpoints by specifying the resource (e.g., "/users", "/posts", etc.) as an argument to the function.

Please note that error handling (e.g., handling network issues, HTTP status errors) is not included in this code snippet. It's generally a good practice to implement error handling to make the code more robust in production applications.
